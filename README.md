This is a little message sender web app which I've created just to learn about `node.js web apps`, the `express` web framework, `REST API` calls performed by client side JS application, `CSS` and animations, `HTML`, the `Google Cloud Platform`'s `App Engine` and `Datastore`, and `continuous deployment` via a `CI/CD server`.

And it happened so that there are no proper tests, and the code could be a lot, lot cleaner and more robust, but there is no time for everything. ^^
